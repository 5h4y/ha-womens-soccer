# Home Assistant Dashboard for US Women's Soccer


- Simple `yaml` that uses the HACS Team Tracker integration to pull in data about NWSL and USWNT games. Changes dynamically based on upcoming + post status. Team Tracker cards also show broadcast network and live possession stats etc. which is pretty handy.
- **Why?** Between inconsistent broadcast deals and the comparative lack of investment in women's sports, it can actually be kind of frustrating to figure out when/where to watch. This dashboard solved that problem for me. 
 
- Will flesh this out more later -- I ended up spending a night reverse-engineering ESPN's API because there's no documentation for women's soccer.
